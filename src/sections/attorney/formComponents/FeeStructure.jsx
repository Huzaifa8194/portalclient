          portal. All fees cover consulting, administration, and processing services and are non-refundable, except as
          outlined in Section 3.9.

        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          All invoices must be paid within 30 days of the invoice date. Late payments will accrue interest according to
          the Swedish Interest Act (RÃ¤ntelag 1975:635) and the Danish Interest Act. After one reminder, unpaid invoices
          will be transferred to a debt collection agency (Inkasso).
